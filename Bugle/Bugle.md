### Robotics Merit Badge - Part II  
This week's meeting will again feature Robotics Merit Badge. We will meet at the Robotics Lab at the MSOE STEM Center located at 1444 N. Water Street. Scouts will be hands-on working in groups of two or three to program robots and fullfilling merit badge requirements 5 and 6.

[Robot Training Preview](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/16M2Sy83ZJ/) on the Troop 79 Facebook page. Watch a preview of what the scouts will build.  

This Merit Badge is hands-on, and scouts will learn how robots are designed, programmed, and controlled. Scouts will learn how sensors, motors, software, and human decision-making come together to create machines that can move, think, and respond to the world around them.  

Advanced robots are no longer science fiction. They are already working alongside people in factories, hospitals, warehouses, transportation systems, and even in our homes. Over the next few years, robotics and artificial intelligence will become a routine part of daily life, school, and nearly every career path. Understanding how these systems work is becoming not just interesting, but important.  

This badge emphasizes problem-solving, critical thinking, teamwork, and ethical awareness—skills Scouts will need as technology becomes more powerful and more common. No prior robotics experience is required. Curiosity and a willingness to learn are all that’s needed.  

The badge includes a mix of instruction, discussion, and hands-on activities designed for Scouts with varying levels of technical experience.   

The Robotics meetings have planned by **Lisa Pieper**. Lisa has a degree in Enginneering and is a mentor to four different Robotics clubs!

### Camp Long Lake - Two Lodges

This year's Winter Camp will be held at Long Lake Scout Camp near Campbellsport WI. Sleeping and dining will be indoors. We're planning a collection of fun snow and ice activities as well as indoor fun. Sleeping outside will be an option open to adventurous scouts.

- Meet Friday at 6:00pm, depart when packed
- Return Sunday around 1:00pm
- Indoor cabins with bunks
- Cross Country skiing (hopefully), we're checking on ice skating options
- Campfire, ice fishing, Risk (the game), Chess, Scrabble, and your favorite games
- Outdoor activities
- Hiking in the snow
- Tumbling & Leg Wrestling?
- Ping Pong, Pool, and more!

Don't miss it!

### Sleep Outside - Polar Bears at Winter Camp

Want to sleep outside on the deck at Winter Camp? This year a few adventurous youth and wise adults will discover the joys of sleeping under the stars in the winter. The reason is clear. The outside deck at the Lodge will be the warmest, quietest, freshest airiest place to sleep at Winter Camp.

If you want to be the "coolest" scouts at Winter Camp, bring extra gear and join the Frozen Otter Patrol by sleeping outside Friday and/or Saturday evenings. Scouts of any age can do it. Here's what to bring:

- An extra sleeping bag (we'll tuck one into the other).
- The Troop will bring extra sleeping bags if you don't have one.
- Warm thick wool socks
- Wool hat
- Long underwear or warm pajamas
- Cotton or fleece hoodie. You'll want to pull this over your head.
- We will provide a thick foam mattress and a canvas tarp to complete the setup.

**Parents:** The door is very near where we sleep so if a scout gets cold (which is unlikely) s/he can go inside in just a few seconds. Adults monitor the scouts who sleep outside to ensure everyone is setup correctly. Most scouts remark after their first night that they were much warmer than they expected.

## High Adventure Trip to the BWCA - June 20-27

We have secured two BWCA wilderness permits for our first ever High Aventure Trip (HAT). The permits allow for up to 9 people per crew -- one crew will enter at [Snowflake Lake](https://bwca.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=maps.entryhome&locid=27) (OP), and the other at [Lake One](https://bwca.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=maps.entryhome&locid=30) (OP).  

As of 1/29, we have heard from 14 scouts and adults who are interested, and received the $100 downpayment from 12. In theory we have room for 4 more scouts or adults. 

To be eligible for this trip a Scout must be first class or above and be going into 9th grade or above this fall. [Reserve your spot here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1I_MARXWjQGcyJk5poll2FOI0fWZMXqj3Uq-aQfL0X4A/edit/)  A down payment of $100 is required.  The total cost of the trip is estimated to be around $650. Traveling to the Boundary Waters is a rare opportunity, and one scouts should not pass up it they are eligible to attend.

The National Forest Services has produced a series of videos that are required viewing for everyone participating.
