### Meeting Plan   

#### 1. Robotics Merit Badge - Part III (Finale)  
Scouts who have completed most of Robotics MB at the past two meetings will have the opportunity to complete the badge at this week's meeting in about 20 minutes. Each scout missed one of the four station rotations at the first Robotics meeting. Those stations will be repeated so that scouts can attend the class they missed. 

#### 2. Trail to Eagle with Becky Vest 
Older scouts who have made progress at home on requirements for Communications, Citizenship in the Community, or Personal Fitness Merit Badges can share their efforts with Becky. These scouts should check their email for details of their remaining requirements. 

#### 3. Citizenship in the World
Older scouts who started work on Citizenship in the World can meet with Patrick to work on additional requirements.

#### 4. Open Advancement
Younger scouts can work on Tenderfoot, 2nd Class and 1st Class requirements.

### It was our warmest winter camp on record!

Temperatures hit 50 both Saturday and Sunday, but despite the spring temperatures, there was enough snow for our activity plan -- including cross country skiing and snow ball fights. 

The Rotary Cabin at Long Lake Scout Camp was outstanding. Separate bunk rooms for boys and girls, a kitchen in the common room, showers, WIFI (we didn't tell the scouts), and a friendly and very helpful camp ranger (Marty).  

Hazel and Henry spent their first nights ever sleeping under a big tarp outside under the stars with temperatures hitting 25 overnight.  

Highlights of the weekend include:
- Five compass courses design by Kevin, Hazel and Henry
- Geo Caching adventure
- Citizenship in the World req #1 and #2 for older scouts
- Patrol Olympics with a snowman building contest, group charades, minefield, and a three way tug-a-war. 
- Delicious meals prepared by Kraken, Fire Quacker, and Screaming Eagle patrols. 
- Leg wrestling and tilt-a-whirl (both firsts for T79) 
- Scout led evening entertainment: 
  - Switch Interview Improv
  - "Murder" with the queen of spades
  - A lively game of Mafia led by Winnie Black and won by a very clever and devious Jack Porter

Thank you to parents Rachel Lyden and Kevin Barry who joined Mindy and Patrick for for the weekend!!


## High Adventure Trip to the BWCA - June 20-27

We have secured two BWCA wilderness permits for our first ever High Aventure Trip (HAT). The permits allow for up to 9 people per crew -- one crew will enter at [Snowflake Lake](https://bwca.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=maps.entryhome&locid=27) (OP), and the other at [Lake One](https://bwca.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=maps.entryhome&locid=30) (OP).  

As of 2/21, we have heard from 14 scouts and adults who are interested, and received the $100 downpayment from 13. In theory we have room for 4 more scouts or adults. 

To be eligible for this trip a Scout must be first class or above and be going into 9th grade or above this fall. [Reserve your spot here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1I_MARXWjQGcyJk5poll2FOI0fWZMXqj3Uq-aQfL0X4A/edit/)  A down payment of $100 is required.  The total cost of the trip is estimated to be around $650. Traveling to the Boundary Waters is a rare opportunity, and one scouts should not pass up it they are eligible to attend.

The National Forest Services has produced a series of videos that are required viewing for everyone participating.

## Sparklers

- A man was out for a drive when he saw two penguins standing on the shoulder so he pulls over, picks them up, and puts them in the back seat. Later he stops for gas and the clerk notices the penguins and says, “What are those penguins doing in the back of your car?” The man says, “I found them on the road and they looked lost, so I picked them up”. “You should take them to the zoo!” replied the clerk. “What a good idea,” said the man, and then pays for his gas and drives off. The next day he goes to the same gas station and the same clerk notices the penguins still in the car. He says to the man, “I thought you were taking them to the zoo?”  The man replies, “I did... they loved it... and now I’m going to take them to the movies!”
