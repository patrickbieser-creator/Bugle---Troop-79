Troop 79 Summer Camp is July 26 - Aug 1, 2026. Camp will be held at Tesomas Scout Camp near Rhinelander, WI.This is a great opportunity to experience Scouting's finest. Fathers and mothers are welcome and encouraged to attend for part or all of the week.  

All scouts are encouraged to attend summer camp.

Jason is always available on Band and will be at this week's meeting if you have any questions. 

## Summer Camp Scholarships Available

Unity Lutheran Church has generously offered to provide financial aid to Scouts of Troop 79 who need financial assistance to attend our summer camp at Tesomas this year. Unity is Troop 79’s Charter Organization. This program is not intended to provide all camp fees, but to supplement funds that the Scout has earned through troop fundraising. This needs‑based scholarship supports families experiencing financial hardship and ensures every Scout has the opportunity to participate in the outdoor adventure and personal growth that camp provides.

Scholarships are limited and awarded based on demonstrated need.

Application deadline is March 1st. Please use this Google form to apply. All submissions are confidential.

There is some confusion about the 12 weeks of fitness tracking. The requirements changed recently. 

### Requirement 6 — Plan a 12-Week Fitness Program 
**What it requires:**
- Design a personalized 12-week fitness plan including diet goals
- Get it approved by the counselor BEFORE starting
- Include aerobic, strength, and flexibility components
- Track progress in a written log  
- The exact requirements can be found here:  [Personal Fitness MB Requirements](https://www.Scouting.org/merit-badges/personal-fitness/)  

**Keys**
- If you use a sports or PE class it must match the plan and be Pre-Approved
- Missing weeks is only allowed with counselor approval
- Logs must show dates, activity type, duration or intensity, progress notes
- (Scouts often forget the diet goals)

### Requirement 7 — Complete the 12 Week Plan 
**What it requires:**
- Follow the specific plan you designed and had approved
- Keep logs
- Re-test at weeks 4, 8, and end to compare to the assessment you did in Requirement 4 (See chart below)
  - Assessment includes measures of flexibility, of aerobic fitness, strength and endurance 
  - e.g. sit and reach test, pushups or pullups in 60 seconds, sit-ups in 60 seconds
  - These tests require separate tracking. 
- Track nutrition logs 
- Discuss results with counselor  
- The exact requirements can be found here:  [Personal Fitness MB Requirements](https://www.Scouting.org/merit-badges/personal-fitness/)  

After you read the requirements online contact Becky Vest at rlvest76@gmail.com with any questions. She is happy to make time for you.

## High Adventure Trip to the BWCA - June 20-27

We are looking for one more female adult to attend this year's High Adventure Trip. Reply to this email if you might be interested.

We have secured two BWCA wilderness permits for our first ever High Adventure Trip (HAT). The permits allow for up to 9 people per crew -- one crew will enter at [Snowflake Lake](https://bwca.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=maps.entryhome&locid=27) (OP), and the other at [Lake One](https://bwca.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=maps.entryhome&locid=30) (OP).  

As of 2/21, we have heard from 14 Scouts and adults who are interested, and received the $100 downpayment from 13. In theory we have room for 4 more Scouts or adults. 

To be eligible for this trip a Scout must be first class or above and be going into 9th grade or above this fall. [Reserve your spot here.](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1I_MARXWjQGcyJk5poll2FOI0fWZMXqj3Uq-aQfL0X4A/edit/)  A down payment of $100 is required.  The total cost of the trip is estimated to be around $650. Traveling to the Boundary Waters is a rare opportunity, and a Scout should not pass up it they are eligible to attend.

The National Forest Services has produced a series of videos that are required viewing for everyone participating.

## Sparklers

- When the worst time to have a heart attack? Probably during a game of charades.
- I think it's shameful that some parents feed their kids frozen pizzas. They could at least put them in the oven.
- Did you know the first French Fries were not cooked in France. They were cooked in grease.
- Did you hear about the claustrophobic astronaut. He just needed some space.
- I stayed up all night wondering where the sun had gone. And then it dawned on me.
- My son thought he was being clever when he asked me if he was adopted. I told him "not yet."
